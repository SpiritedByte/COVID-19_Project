# COVIDTracker (by SpiritedByte)

# What is it?
It is a Python 3 script that locally stores the latest England data for COVID-19 (deaths and cases), and then uses Matplotlib to plot the data onto a graph (bar graph by default).

It was created to play around with Python and develop my skills.

# Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+

# Modules used
* os
* sys
* pathlib
* pandas
* requests
* traceback

The script should handle the rest.
