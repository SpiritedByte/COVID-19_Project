I think I might rewrite this, because it's upsetting me how this is set out.

# Aims
The aim of this project is to track changes over time with the current COVID-19 situation in the United Kingdom.
# Will it ever be finished?
~~Probably not. This is just a small project to practice my Python skills, and I will probably never be happy with the outcome either way.~~
I have made quite a bit of progress on this project - more than I would have thought I could do.
# To-Do List

- [x] Get .csv data
- [x] Save .csv data
- [x] Parse .csv data
-	[x] Save to Pandas DataFrame
-	[x] Filter rows except 'England'
-	[x] Get dates and cumulative values
- [ ] Plot data
-	[ ] Auto-updating
-	[ ] Standalone Python program
-	[x] Plot initial cases
-	[x] Plot initial deaths
-	[ ] Matplotlib alternative (will probably happen at the same time as creating the standalone Python program

# Issues
- [ ] Fix fork() crash on macOS (need to think of an alternative way that makes it suitable across multiple operating systems)

(Again, this is a small project to practice my Python abilities. This may never be finished but I thought I may as well showcase my progress on the master branch)
