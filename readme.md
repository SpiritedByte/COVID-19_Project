# Aims
The aim of this project is to track changes over time with the current COVID-19 situation in the United Kingdom.
# Will it ever be finished?
~~Probably not. This is just a small project to practice my Python skills, and I will probably never be happy with the outcome either way.~~
I have made quite a bit of progress on this project - more than I would have thought I could do.
